# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰

Contributing go a long way, there are lots of ways you can still help, even if you can't contribute code. All methods are outlined in the sections below, but the two main things other than code are testing and creating issues.

## Developing

## Documentation

Documentation is especially helpful! You can add something that hasn't been covered in the docs yet, and help guide others with your experience.

## Testing

The easiest way to contribute. You're already helping just by using the software, simply use and let us know if you run into problems, or there's some use case you would like to use it for but are not yet covered. This is the most common way we uncover bugs or implement new features.
